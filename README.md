# Dwarves Foundation hardcore place

<img src="comfortzone.jpeg"/>

A Dwarf never stop learning, and this is the space for our team members research/discuss about hard things. Hard things are? Just not easy things. We believe continous learning and getting out of comfort zone are the way to be the best developer.

# Hard things list

- Clean code
- Design pattern
- Math
- OS/Kernel
- Compiler/Parser
- Hardware, embedded
- Functional programming (with deep theory, not just first class function or pure function)
- Algorithm in depth (not just some simple and well-known like sorting..)
- Theory stuffs: distributed programming, database theory, ...

# Rules

- Everyone commits the topic and does research in 02 weeks.
- Everything must be in depth.
 - What means? Deep understanding about what you research. For example:
  - Shoudn't: Go builds fast.
  - Recommended: Go builds so fast because its innovation in dependence analysic which is able to reorder the execution statements that makes fast compilation.
- Translating paper is acceptable.

# Punishment

If someone register a topic and not release on time, 10$ will be charged to the fund that used for buying technical books.
